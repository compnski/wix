Rough Overview

A 4x game with wizards and warriors and magic. Unit spells can be cast in-combat for buffs or out of combat for permanent bonuses at a per-turn upkeep cost.

Build structures and attract monsters to guard for you?

Sliders -- tradeoffs

Towns generate militia over time to guard town. Can designate to guard other towns or special sites.
Boring to build guard unit in each town. Sucks to trade off building growth vs units.

Specialize units over time from militia. Focus on heroes and fewer more notable units. Think rimworld vs dwarf fortress.
Start with single units, those become.leaders of groups eventually company? 

In MoM some units had many, that can be part of game progression to help keep units relevant.

Your awesome axeman Bunyan from early on becomes Bunyan's Legionnaires or somesuch. Units have xp. Once a unit is big it can be healed by backup or magic.

Ubit becomes hero (maybe one of a group even) for awesomeness during combat. Maybe good rolls or stating down the enemy.

Maybe even based on other units watching.
